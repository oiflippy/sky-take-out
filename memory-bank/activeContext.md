* [2025-05-09 08:43:45] - Debug Status Update: Investigating `java.sql.SQLException: Data truncated for column 'status' at row 1` when inserting into `employee` table. Java `Employee.status` is `Integer`, value is `1`.
* [2025-05-09 08:45:33] - Debug Status Update: Received `employee` table structure. `status` column is `int` with length `0`. This is suspicious.
* [2025-05-09 08:47:00] - Debug Status Update: Diagnosed that `INT` with length `0` for `status` column is likely causing "Data truncated" error for value `1`. The definition is problematic.
* [2025-05-09 09:19:40] - Debug Status Update: Identified root cause: Incorrect column order in `EmployeeMapper.java` `@Insert` statement. `createTime` was being inserted into `status` column. Applied fix by explicitly naming columns in the SQL.
* [2025-05-09 11:13:15] - Architect Task: Analyzed request to modify `EmployeeServiceImpl.java` to use dynamic user IDs for `createUser` and `updateUser`. Confirmed architectural soundness and logged decision. Next step is likely code implementation.
* [2025-05-09 11:16:30] - Code Task: Modified [`sky-server/src/main/java/com/sky/service/impl/EmployeeServiceImpl.java`](sky-server/src/main/java/com/sky/service/impl/EmployeeServiceImpl.java) to use `BaseContext.getCurrentId()` for `createUser` and `updateUser` fields in the `save` method.
* [2025-05-09 11:29:09] - Code Task: Resolved ThreadLocal cleanup issue in [`sky-server/src/main/java/com/sky/config/JwtAuthenticationTokenFilter.java`](sky-server/src/main/java/com/sky/config/JwtAuthenticationTokenFilter.java) by adding `BaseContext.removeCurrentId()` in a `finally` block.
* [2025-05-09 11:37:06] - Integration Check: Completed. Verified changes in `EmployeeServiceImpl.java` (dynamic user ID) and `JwtAuthenticationTokenFilter.java` (ThreadLocal cleanup). Ensured consistency with documentation and Memory Bank. Corrected a minor comment in `EmployeeServiceImpl.java`. Project is ready for build and runtime testing by the user.
